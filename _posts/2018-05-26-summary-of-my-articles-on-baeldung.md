It cannot exist a start without an ending. A few months ago I stopped working at Baeldung and I wanted to thank Baeldung's team all the help they gave me. I would say that learnt a lot of this experience but indeed I think I learnt more than just "a lot".

For now, I will focus on working at Piksel and I will try to make up some time to continue writing technical articles in here.

Finally, this is the final articles where I collaborated at Baeldung:

- [Migrating from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5](http://www.baeldung.com/junit-5-migration)
- [Introduction to Spring Cloud Stream](http://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-stream)
- [Introduction to Spring Cloud Consul](http://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-consul)
- [Introduction to Apache Curator](http://www.baeldung.com/apache-curator)
- [Mockito and JUnit 5](http://www.baeldung.com/mockito-junit-5-extension)
- [A Guide to Multitenancy in Hibernate 5](http://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-5-multitenancy)
