I will show how we improved our automation testing cycle using CloudFormation, S3, Jenkins and Docker.

# Objective

As part of an agile approach, we always try to improve our practices and this time the area of improvement was around automation testing.
We run nightly a suite of acceptance tests run by Jenkins with cucumber / ruby and a plugin that give us an awesome report about failed/passed scenarios & steps that we can track daily. We had a lot of technical debt and was something that was a bit overlook and simply put our QA team did not have time to work in all the areas that were missing.

There are some obvious drawback though in the current approach

+ Execution time was nearly 4 hours. You will be wondering why? mainly the database we use is the same that has been running since months ago, with a lot of data on it, as result of multiple execution of automation tests.

+ We use the same machine that we use for development, so running of automation test impacts negatively to our daily work and we therefore postpone the launch of these tests to be run by night. This is not a good idea as ideally we want to have quick feedback if something is broken!

+ We use the same database, so the outcome of the tests could pollute our dev environment. To mitigate this we changed radically the approach of our tests so we always create the conditions in our database before the run are tests, execute the scenarios and eventually wipe out all data which was created as result of the test

# Solution

I stumbled upon CloudFormation that allow us to handle infrastructure as code. Instead of setting up their environments and applications by hand, they build a template and use it to create all of the necessary resources, collectively known as a CloudFormation stack. This model removes opportunities for manual error, increases efficiency, and ensures consistent configurations over time. We can configure everything we need in AWS like VPC, EIP (Elastic IPs), ELB(Elastic Load Balancers), EC2 instances and anything in the AWS universe and beyond. The only thing you need is define your CloudFormation template and create a stack using either Cloudformation console or if you prefer it using AWS cli tools.  

At the same time we tackled this drastic change, the team took opportunity to improve other few things.

+ We decided to use a new separate RDS instance that would be used exclusively for automation testing
+ We improve our Cucumber execution test to add "post" execution steps that will wipe out the tables after execution of each scenario.

So here is the non-so-crazy idea?

What if we could launch our automated acceptance tests against an independent EC2 instance with everything we need on demand? Now EC2 bill us by second, so the economic benefits are obvious as we would only pay for the time the EC2 instance is used for that purpose. On top of that, our development team can work smoothly in our development environment without being impacted by the execution of the acceptance tests.

Now we can schedule EC2 shutdown in non-business timetable and execute on demand (or nightly)
Our monthly bill will be now half of the costs we had in the past!

So our new improved process would happen after succesful deployment into our development environment.

 + Create a new Cloudformation stack that will imply EC2,EIP,VPC,networks, etc.
 + Obtain the EC2 IP adress
 + Run the automation tests against this instance
 + Delete the CloudFormation stack.

The challenges here is that the temporary EC2 instance needs to have all the artifacts and with the same versions we have in our development environment. Luckily enough we took the decision a while ago to use docker images, so it should not that hard to reach that state.

The following guide summarize the steps to follow. It's not intended to be a detailed walk through, I guess you can get the idea

## 1. Install the plugin in your jenkins server.

The following [CloudFormation jenkins plugin][1] worked like a charm.

You can update Jenkins via the plugins page, just search for Cloudformation , install it and there is no need of restaring jenkis.
This will give you some steps that will be available in our Jenkins job.

## 2. Define a cloudFormation template.

I used as reference one of the examples templates to create an EC2 instance.
There are many snippets at
We took ownership of the template as we foresee there will be changes.
We create a new S3 bucket to organize out templates in case we need more. We uploaded it to S3, because integration with CloudFormation
is seamless, we just need to obtain its URL from the S3 console.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/s3-cloudformation-template.png)

The templates allow configuration parameters that determine for example which EC2 instance type will be used, the keypairs to provide ssh access to the EC2 instance and any paremeter that you may need to make your template. Cloudformation itself is complex enough to spend a whole boook chapter on that, so we are scratching the surface here

## 3. Obtain AWS keys and Secrets
If you have already used AWS-cli probably you have this already. Otherwise you need to create them, and keep them safe because internally the API used by the Jenkins plugin requires that information.

## 4. Configure a freestyle Jenkins job. See below my settings (hiding credentials!)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jenkins-cloudformation-config.png)

Important tip: Here is worthy mentioning that the region you chose must be exactly the same where yout keypairs exist.

## 5. Execute your Jenkins job

Be aware that all these tests imply the creation of EC2 instances. If you forget to remove them, your wallet may suffer and you will have to pay some dollars at the end of the month.

So now I have a shiny new EC2 instance..... but is nearly empty!

.. so the next step was figuring out the easiest way to install everything that would allow me to spin up the same containers with the latest code.  My idea was having a fresh EC2 instance and find a way that CloudFormation would allow me to run a shell script or secuence of step

What did i need at least
 + SVN client
 + docker client
 + get based scripts that handle retrieval of properties, and execution of docker containers
 + change permissions directories and file ownershiop
 + execute everything

 The syntax itÂ´s not precisely user friendly, so I feared that I would end up with a sequence of "" and "\n" and escape characters.

 So then I thought ... well we have already everything in our development machine, and I remembered that we can create AMI fron a running EC2 instance. Also, as part of our existing CI we use the pipeline plugin and ssh to our machine to launch a script that pulls the images with a specific tag from the docker registry and restart all the containers. So the pieces were already there, was just a matter of wiring them together!

 So I took the easiest path (lazy mode some times work for me!)

  + Create AMI from our AWS EC2 development machine
  + Obtain its id
  + Modify again the cloudformation template, so for the region where my stack would be running I associated my AMI ID.
    Do not forget to reupload to S3 as that is the source used by the jenkins plugin
    The section within the template is

```json
    "Mappings" : {
    "RegionMap" : {
      "us-east-1"      : { "AMI" : "ami-7f418316" },
      "us-west-1"      : { "AMI" : "ami-951945d0" },
      "us-west-2"      : { "AMI" : "ami-16fd7026" },
      "eu-west-1"      : { "AMI" : "ami-b0e43fc9" },
      "sa-east-1"      : { "AMI" : "ami-3e3be423" },
      "ap-southeast-1" : { "AMI" : "ami-74dda626" },
      "ap-southeast-2" : { "AMI" : "ami-b3990e89" },
      "ap-northeast-1" : { "AMI" : "ami-dcfa4edd" }
    }
  }
  ```

  + Modify  the UserData section to look like

  ```json
  "UserData"       : { "Fn::Base64" : { "Fn::Join" : ["", [
          "#!/bin/bash\n",
          "yum update -y aws-cfn-bootstrap\n",
          "cd /home/ec2-user/docker\n",
          "/home/ec2-user/docker/deploy_all.sh trunk development\n",
          "/opt/aws/bin/cfn-signal -e 0 -r \"WebServer setup complete\" '", { "Ref" : "WebServerWaitHandle" }, "'\n"
        ]]}}
```

## 6. Integrate with our automation suite test

So as result now Jenkins creates a new EC2 instance with everything we need, it runs all the containers ready to receive the requests from our our acceptance tests. However there are still some challenges to be solved...

The plugin does not tell us anything about the recently created EC2 instance.

We needed the IP address at least, so we can target our Cucumber tests against that machine.
I learnt that we can define output variables that we can populate using functions that allow us to access properties of
any of the AWS object types we created during the process. In our case the following snippet was enough

```json
"Outputs" : {
    "PublicIp" : {
      "Value" : { "Fn::Join" : [ "", ["", { "Fn::GetAtt" : ["WebServerInstance", "PublicIp"] }]]},
      "Description" : "EC2 Public IP"
    }
  }
```

Browsing the [Github Source code for CloudFormation Jenkins plugin][2] I found out that for every output variable, it creates a environment variable.

CloudFormationBuildWrapper.java

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-cloudformation-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/syncapse/jenkinsci/plugins/awscloudformationwrapper/CloudFormationBuildWrapper.java

```java
try {
				if (cloudFormation.create()) {
					cloudFormations.add(cloudFormation);
					env.putAll(cloudFormation.getOutputs());
				} else {
					build.setResult(Result.FAILURE);
					success = false;
					break;
				}
			} catch (TimeoutException e) {
				listener.getLogger()
						.append("ERROR creating stack with name "
								+ stackBean.getStackName()
								+ ". Operation timedout. Try increasing the timeout period in your stack configuration.");
				build.setResult(Result.FAILURE);
				success = false;
				break;
			}
```

The class CloudFormation.java is responsible of creating the output variable as environment variable following a convention

stack_name_outputvariablename

In our case assuming our stack name was "automation" it will expose a variable named "automation_PublicIp"  

So now we can use that variable to inform our cucumber test about which is the target.
We do that using Execute Shell build step

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
rvm use "ruby@gemset"
#set -e
bundle install
bundle exec cucumber PALM_HOST=${automation_PublicIp} TARGET_ENV=aws-automation PALM_CLEAN=true --tags=@regression -f pretty -f json -o cucumber.json
```

## 7. Delete everything

Once the suite has been run , the same AWS ClouFormation plugin offer us a post build step in order to remove the CloudFormation stack.
You can wipe out a CloudFormation stack if you provide the stack name

# A few bumps on the road

Just so I do not forget I will mention here some of the "gotchas" faced while running the whole process.
So you can imagine I had to repeat the whole sequence over and over again till get it right!

I struggled a lot initially just starting the whole process to create the EC2 instance.
While all the components were created correctly, once the last step was reached I got a message saying that my keypairs did not exist.
The bottom of the issue was related with the Region itself. Our keypairs are associated to a region and when we create a cloudformation stack we must specify the region. It both do not match you will have a hard time figuring out what is going on.

Next issue was with a silly limit associated with the maximun number of elastic ips (EIP). We already have allocated 5 EIPs so I had to deallocate some of the non-used ones.

During creation of the Cloudformation stack, any of the above errors would lead to a status of ROLLBACK_COMPLETED. In that case you need to delete the stack itself otherwise the plugin will not work, because the plugin will try to update an existing stack with a non recoverable state. Other alternative is that in the plugin configuration you change the name of your stack so there are no conflicts with existing ones.
