## Roles
- Data Engineers: Process and transform large data into a database
- Data Scientists: Design models to understand the data and produce a result
- Application Developers: Use the tools provided by the data engineers and the results from the models by Data Scientists into something everybody can understand and use.
- Machine Learning engineers: Train and work with models.

## Components in a Machine Learning System
- Configuration
- Data Collection
