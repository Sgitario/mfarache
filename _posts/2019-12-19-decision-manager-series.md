We'll be starting a session walkthrough about the Red Hat Automation Manager solution. This product allows to automate decisions and process using the [BPMN 2.0](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/) standard through [Drools](https://sgitario.github.io/drools-introduction/) and/or [jBPM](https://sgitario.github.io/jbpm-introduction/). 

The [Automation Manager](https://sgitario.github.io/automation-manager/) solution integrates everything. It supports a large number of architectures with different topologies and is currently in use by a large number of companies. 

Nowadays, Red Hat is making an effort to implement a new cloud-native solution of [Automation Manager](https://sgitario.github.io/automation-manager/) called [Kogito](https://sgitario.github.io/kogito-introduction/).
