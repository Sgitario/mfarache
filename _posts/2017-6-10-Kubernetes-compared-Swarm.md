tags: [ kubernetes, docker]

I wanted to compare Kubernetes with Docker Swarm. Why? Because after reviewing some comparisons , all of them  seem to mention identical featuresto me. Speaking with some colleagues they told me it would be crazy to run Docker swarm in production and I wanted to know why.
IÂ´m sure I was missing something, so I wanted to know the "goodies" of K8. So as introduction step, the best thing is understanding the main concepts, how it works and try to get my hands dirty. I will start a series on Kubernetes and this will be the introduction to the main concepts as I learn them, so be benevolent if I say something stupid.
