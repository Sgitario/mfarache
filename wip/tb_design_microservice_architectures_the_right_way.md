- Introduction

- Great architecture

* Scales development teams
* Delivers quality
* Enables high performance / low cost
* Supports future features naturally

- Principles

* Each micro service application owns its database
* No other service is allowed to connect to the database
* Other services use only the service interface (API + Events)

- Misconceptions

1.- Micro Services enable our teams to choose the best programming languages and frameworks for their tasks.
2.- Code generation is evil. (creating code from schemas is 100% reliable)
3.- The event log must be the source of truth. (sometimes it's easier if services manage their own resources)
4.- Developers can maintan no more than 3 services each.
