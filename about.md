Passionate software engineer with more than 10 years now. I enjoy looking for optimal and comprehensive solutions while always keeping in mind the long term effects, and applying design principles like KISS, TDD, and Agile. My passion is learning new technologies and methodologies, meeting challenges and making useful frameworks.
